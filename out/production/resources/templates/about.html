                    <p>
                        CyberConnector is designed to extensively adopt open geospatial standards/specifications, including
                        the ISO geospatial data and metadata standards and standard-based geospatial web service, workflows, and
                        sensor web technologies are the foundation. It bridges the sensors and earth science models through
                        standard interfaces, such as Web Processing Service, Sensor Planning Service, and Catalogue Service for
                        the Web. It facilitates the automatic preparation and feeding of both historic and near-real time Earth
                        Observation customized data and on-demand derived products into Earth science models.The standard
                        interfaces allow the automatic handshaking between components with workflow designers and
                        <span id="para2">underlying</span> workflow execution language.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	This system provides users with an entrance to access the virtual geospatial data products registered in 
                    	CyberConnector's CSW. The products are not present until someone requests them. Once a request is 
                    	received, CyberConnector will invoke the product generation processing model on the server side and 
                    	execute the model by adopting appropriate geoprocessing Web services. When the execution is over, the 
                    	outputted products will be sent back to the data consumers automatically.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="bg color-light">Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        Earth observation (EO) through sensors is the most important way to collect Earth science data. It
                        is very common that scientists who conduct data-intensive Earth science research need to integrate
                        and analyze multi-source EO datasets, which are typically very diverse in the collecting sensors,
                        data formats, projections, spatial/temporal resolutions and coverage, access methods, quality,
                        documentation, and user support. Studies showed that scientists who used satellite remote sensing
                        data for data-intensive geospatial science applications had to spend over 60% of their time just for
                        data acquisition, preprocessing, and post-processing. The major barriers are 1) difficulty to
                        find and obtain the needed data from geographically distributed data sources, 2) data not in
                        ready-to-analyze form, 3) the unavailability of the needed data products, and 4) lack of or inadequate
                        computing resources to handle the large volumes of data. The goal of CyberConnector is to
                        remove or significantly lower these major barriers and to demonstrate the dramatic reduction of
                        <span id="para3">the</span> time and efforts.

                    <h3 class="bg color-light">Objectives</h3>
                    <p>CyberConnector aims to achieve objectives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Efficiently and robustly preparing and feeding EO data to ESMs</li>

                    <h4>Data Discovery and Retrieval Services (DDRS)</h4>
                    <p>
                        DDRS is one of the two subcomponents in the framework that connect to the EO sensor and data
                        world. The major functions of DDRS are to discover and obtain data. It uses open standards for
                        interfacing with data sources, allowing a web sensor or an EO data system equipped with standard
                        interfaces to be easily plugged into the framework.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Science Goal Monitoring Services (SGMS)</h4>
                    <p>
                        SGMS takes ESM outputs and in many cases the geophysical products generated by PIAS as inputs to
                        analyze against science goals for determining whether additional or refined geophysical products
                        are needed by the model to meet these goals. Use of geophysical products in SGMS rather than
                        sensor measurements hides the complexity of the EO world from science-goal analysis and enables
                        dynamic plug-in and removal of sensors without affecting SGMS.
