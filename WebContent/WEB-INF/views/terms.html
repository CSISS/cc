			<p>1. Scope</p>
			<p>1.1. Any use of this web site provided by Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems, George Mason University ("CSISS"), "CyberConnector Web Site", is subject to these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use may be amended, modified or replaced by other terms and conditions, e.g . for the purchase of products and services. With log-in, or where a log-in is not required, in accessing or using the CyberConnector Web Site these Terms of Use are accepted in their then current version.</p>
			<p>1.2. In the case of Web offers aimed at companies or public enterprises, such companies or enterprises are represented by the user and must assume that the user has appropriate knowledge and acts accordingly.</p>

			<p>2. Services</p>
			<p>2.1. This CyberConnector Web Site contains specific information and software, as well as - as the case may be - related documentation, for viewing or downloading.</p>
			<p>2.2. CSISS may stop the operation of the CyberConnector Web Site in full or in part at any time. Due to the nature of the internet and computer systems, CSISS cannot accept any liability for the continuous availability of the CyberConnector Web Site.</p>

			<p>3. Registration, Password</p>
			<p>3.1. Some pages of the CyberConnector Web Site may be password protected. In the interest of safety and security of the business transactions, only registered Users may access said pages. CSISS reserves the right to deny registration to any User. CSISS particularly reserves the right to determine certain sites, which were previously freely accessible, subject to registration. CSISS is entitled, at any time and without obligation to give reasons, to deny the User the right to access the password-protected area by blocking its User Data (as defined below), in particular if the User </p>
			<p>- uses false data for the purpose of registration;</p>
			<p>- violates these Terms of Use or neglects its duty of care with regard to User Data; </p>
			<p>- violates any applicable laws in the access to or use of the CyberConnector Web Site; or </p>
			<p>- did not use the CyberConnector Web Site for a longer period.</p>
			<p>3.2. For registration the User shall give accurate information and, where such information changes over time, update such information (to the extent possible: online) without undue delay. The User shall ensure that its e-mail address, as supplied to CSISS, is current at all times and an address at which the User can be contacted.</p>
			<p>3.3. Upon registration the User will be provided with an access code, comprising a User ID and a password ("User Data"). On first access the User shall promptly change the password received from CSISS into a password known only to the User. The User Data allows the User to view or change its data or, as applicable, to withdraw its consent to data processing.</p>
			<p>3.4. The User shall ensure that User Data is not accessible by third parties and is liable for all transactions and other activities carried out under its User Data. At the end of each online session, the User shall log-off from the password protected websites. If and to the extent the User becomes aware that third parties are misusing its User Data the User shall notify CSISS thereof without undue delay in writing, or, as the case may be, by e-mail.</p>
			<p>3.5. After receipt of the notice under paragraph 3.4, CSISS will deny access to the password-protected area under such User Data. Access by the User will only be possible again upon the User's application to CSISS or upon new registration.</p>
			<p>3.6. The User may at any time request termination of its registration in writing, provided that the deletion will not violate the proper performance of contractual relationships. In such event CSISS will remove all user data and other stored personally identifiable data of the User as soon as these data are no longer needed.</p>

			<p>4.1. The use of any information, software and documentation made available on or via this CyberConnector Web Site is subject to these Terms of Use or, in case of updating information, software or documentation, subject to the applicable license terms previously agreed to with CSISS.

			<p>4.2. CSISS grants User a non-exclusive and non-transferable license, which may not be sublicensed, to use the information, software and documentation made available to the User on or via the CyberConnector Web Site to the extent agreed, or in the event of no such agreement to the extent of the purpose intended by CSISS in making same available.</p>
			<p>4.3. Software shall be made available at no expense in object code. There shall be no right for the source code to be made available.

In such case CSISS shall make the source code available in return for the payment of costs.</p>
			<p>4.4. Information, software and documentation may not be distributed by the User to any third party at any time nor may it be rented or in any other way made available.
