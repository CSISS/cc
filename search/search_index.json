Installation Prerequisite Java 1.8+ (mandatory, OpenJDK) Apache Tomcat 8.0+ (mandatory, web container) MySQL 5.5+ (mandatory, database, initialize it with db/cc.empty.sql) ncWMS 2.4.1+ (mandatory, download ncWMS.war and deploy it into Tomcat webapps folder) cc-thredds-pycsw (optional, if you plan to set up your own catalog) Apache Maven 3.5.0+ (optional, building CyberConnector.war from source) Quick Start Java War Package To use CyberConnector, download the latest release war and copy it to the webapps directory of Tomcat. Start Tomcat. After the tomcat is fully started, configure the database connection. The configuration files are WEB-INF/classes/config.properties (database url, default: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cyberconnector) and WEB-INF/classes/cc_secret.properties (database username and password: database_user=root database_password=xxxxxxxx). Fill the fields with correct values. ( Note: the database must be initiated first. ) Then enter the following URL into browser address bar to open CyberConnector: http://your-ip:your-port/CyberConnector-<version>/web/CyberConnector Replace the your-ip , your-port , CyberConnector-<version> with the real name of your tomcat and downloaded CyberConnector package. For example, localhost:8080 , CyberConnector-0.6.6 . Cloud Instance Template We provide a ready-to-use cloud template for you to install on mainstream cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, OpenStack and CloudStack. Please go here to download the template. Docker Image We published a Docker image in DockerHub for docker users. The pull command is: docker pull csiss/cyberconnector Modules COVALI - a sub-system for comparison and validation of atmospheric and other Earth science models (funded by EarthCube CyberWay ) CyberConnector Searcher - a sub-system for searching Earth observations, model results or virtual data products (VDP) CyberConnector Orderer - a sub-system for orderring VDP (customizing existing observations into ready-to-use format) CyberConnector Service Register - a sub-system for registering and searching geoprocessing web services Usage COVALI Example: Animation Demo: Roam around the Globe COVALI has different projection options and 3-D view to enable multi-perspective viewing the data. Search Data search in UCAR server search in the public folder Search results are listed in a panel where users can directly download the files or load them into the maps. Add Data COVALI supports visualizing GRIB/NetCDF data on the maps. Settings COVALI provides a Settings menu to controll the two maps. It allows users to manage the added data layers. Tools COVALI provides a number of tools to facilitate the comparison and validation among the data. Statistic Report Users can draw points or lines on the map to get a statistics on the values on the points or along the lines. Map rotation Use Alt+Shift+Drag to rotate the map.
